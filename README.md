Adds various stuff to Lethal Company. I'll be using this to just play around with modding and add various things such as items, traps, and (hopefully) moons and enemies. List of what currently exists is below.
I'm still a Unity noob so there will probably be bugs. Please report any you find on the Github issues page:
